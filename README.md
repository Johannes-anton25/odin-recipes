# Recipe Showcase
Welcome to my Recipe Showcase! This project is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and features three of my favorite dishes: Pork Adobo, Pork Giniling, and Lumpia. Initially created using only HTML, I’ve recently enhanced the site with my newly learned CSS skills, making it more visually appealing and enjoyable to explore.

# Overview
As a food lover, I’m excited to share these recipes that I truly enjoy. Here’s what you can expect from this project:
* Three Delicious Recipes: Detailed ingredients and instructions for each dish, perfect for anyone who appreciates good food.
* Visual Enhancements: Thanks to my improved CSS skills, the design now looks much better, reflecting the joy these recipes bring.

# Features
* Improved Typography: Thoughtful font choices and spacing make the text easier to read and more inviting.
* Cohesive Color Palette: A warm and vibrant color scheme brings the recipes to life and adds a touch of personality.
