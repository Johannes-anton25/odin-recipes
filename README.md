This project is part of my journey in The Odin Project, where I showcase three of my favorite dishes: Pork Adobo, Pork Giniling, and Fried Chicken. Created using only HTML, this project not only reflects my budding programming skills but also my appreciation for simple, delicious cooking. Iâ€™m excited to share these recipes as I continue to learn and grow in web development!
