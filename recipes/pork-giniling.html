    <p>
      Pork Giniling is a pork dish that makes use of ground pork as the primary
      ingredient. Ground pork is stewed in tomato sauce and water to bring out
      the taste while vegetables such as carrots and potatoes (some also like
      this with raisins and green peas) are added for additional flavor and
      nutrition.
