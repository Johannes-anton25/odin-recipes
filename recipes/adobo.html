      Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is
      definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork
      slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this
      savory and sour viand. And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to
      introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are
      other renditions of adobo.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pork belly: </strong>For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong>Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dried bay leaves: </strong>Gives off the perfect adobo aroma
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vinegar: </strong>Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly
          unique is its sourness, which we get from vinegar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soy sauce: </strong>There's nothing quite like the salty
          quality of soy sauce!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Peppercorn: </strong>Just for the slightest bit of spice!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water: </strong>As this has a stew, we will definitely be
          using plenty of water!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Salt: </strong>And to make sure everything is nice and
          flavorful, you will be using some salt too.
