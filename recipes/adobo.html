    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pork belly – For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
      <li>Garlic – Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
      <li>Dried bay leaves – Gives off the perfect adobo aroma</li>
      <li>
        Vinegar – Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its
        sourness, which we get from vinegar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soy sauce – There’s nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!
      </li>
      <li>Peppercorn – Just for the slightest bit of spice!</li>
      <li>
        Water – As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt – And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be
        using some salt too.
      </li>
    </ul>
