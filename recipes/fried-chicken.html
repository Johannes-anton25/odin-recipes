      What is comfort food to you? If you’re like me, one of the images that
      comes to mind is a gorgeously crispy fried chicken. Simple but flavorful,
      fried chicken is a treat for both kids and adults alike. Whether you’re
      enjoying it at a birthday party or serving it as an appetizer for game
      night, crispy fried chicken is a classic choice.
